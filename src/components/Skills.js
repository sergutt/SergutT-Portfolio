                I possess a diverse set of technical skills including
                proficiency in font-end development technologies such as React,
                React Native, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB,
                Express.js, Firebase, JSON, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Jquery. I am
                also well-versed in API development, REST APIs, MySQL, Git, SQL,
                and NoSQL. In addition to my technical skills, I have experience
                in Customer Experience, Office Administration, and Data Entry,
                and am a strong team player. I have hands-on experience working
                with the Sabre reservation system and Defense Travel System, and
                am adept at using Microsoft Office tools such as Word, Excel,
                and PowerPoint. With my broad skill set and ability to adapt to
                new technologies and systems, I am confident in my ability to
                contribute to any project and collaborate effectively with my
                colleagues.
